# The Clock 

A modern digital clock that actually deserves a spot on your desk. Not another plastic alarm clock. Not another RGB brick. "The Clock" is a DIY project for people who care about how things look as much as how they work.

Clean, minimal, and a little bit obsessive, it is designed to evolve over time. New design ideas, new cases, new features. The long term goal is to build the ultimate desk clock.
